We collected hair samples of mixed men and women in the 20-55 age group and used Hitachi S-4700 SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) to generate hair microscopic 
images.  First, the sample hair is screened, classified, and cut. The hair section is attached to the conductive tape coated with carbon on both sides, fixed 
on the metal aluminum rod,and platinum is used as the metal target. The spray coating machine performs sputtering coating under a high vacuum. Then, an SEM 
(model: Hitachi S-4700) was used to scan the coated hair sample at 15 kV. . Scan multiple sections of each axis to ensure that the changes in the surface 
of the hair sample seen are uniform and not isolated. The damage to the hair shaft under the scanning electron microscope is divided into three grades: weak 
damage, damage, and high damage.
